Up today as explained in the `Introduction <intro.html>`_ we are focused in Open Value Networks. What does this mean to
you as a user of this system? For instance, all information is public. We believe in openness and transparency so this
is one of the foundational core values. It doesn't mean though we won't appreciate contributions towards more fine
grained access rules. As a matter of fact we are working on restricting some views to individual *context agents* so
in bigger networks there's no information overload.

Introduction
============

The `django-rea <https://github.com/django-rea>`_ organization is created in aim to create a set of building blocks on
which other Django apps can build upon to create network resource planning systems - NRP, as opposed to the more
restricted common patterns we encounter in enterprise resource planning systems - ERP.

The project starts from the `valuenetwork <https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork>`_ project, centered around
`Open Value Networks <http://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page>`_.
This evolved into a NRP gravitating towards openness and transparency.

As we understand somebody's needs might be different than those we have been using it for thus this project.
Which is born to create a set of modular apps on which to develop business apps. In a sense it's another framework in
your toolbox.

In **django-rea** we are going a step forward generalizing and modularizing the previous projects since we think and
understand `REA modelling <https://msu.edu/~mccarth4/>`_ provides an invaluable asset in business model driven
applications.

We encourage everyone to participate.
